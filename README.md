## 🚀 Overview

This project, **Analyzing User Behavior in Online Learning Platforms with Graph Data Structures**, leverages graph algorithms to uncover insights on user engagement patterns, community interactions, and learning progression. With graph structures, we can map and analyze pathways users take within the platform, identify popular content, and understand peer-to-peer interactions. These insights are crucial for refining learning resources and optimizing user experience.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Graph-Based User Analysis** 🧩
  - Model user relationships and interactions on the platform.
- **Content Interaction Metrics** 📚
  - Track engagement, completion rates, and frequency for different content types.
- **Community Insights** 👥
  - Analyze connections among users to understand community dynamics.
- **Progress Monitoring** 🛤️
  - Evaluate learning pathways and identify engagement drop-off points.

## 🔍 Graph Data Structure

The project employs a multi-layered graph structure to capture user and content interactions:

- **Nodes** represent users, content pieces, and connections.
- **Edges** define relationships (e.g., user-to-content interaction, user-to-user engagement).
- **Properties** track user actions, interaction frequency, completion, etc.

### Graph Algorithms

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Track user pathways through content.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Analyze deep interactions.
- **PageRank**: Identify key users and popular content nodes.
- **Centrality Measures**: Determine central users and high-impact content.

## 📈 Results

The project provides actionable insights into:
- **Engagement Patterns**: Identifies the content that keeps users engaged.
- **Key Influencers**: Reveals users central to peer interactions.
- **Learning Pathways**: Visualizes common learning routes.
- **Engagement Drop-off Points**: Detects areas where user engagement declines.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Tracking**: Integrate live data for ongoing behavior analysis.
- **Enhanced ML Models**: Use predictive modeling for user engagement forecasts.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Incorporate more data streams for a richer analysis.
